The module challenge 9 is a README generator that uses Node.js. It can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project. After complete a series of question prompts in the commmand line, a README.md file is automatic created within the 'developcls
' sub-folder.
